## Introduction
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activityData <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header=T, quote="\"", sep=",")
```

2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Process/transform the data
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date)
activityDataWithoutNAs <- activityData
activityDataWithoutNAs[is.na(activityDataWithoutNAs$steps), "steps"] <- 0
stepsPerDayNoNAs <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityDataWithoutNAs, sum)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1.Calculate the total number of steps taken per day.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date)
activityData <- na.omit(activityData)
numberOfStepsTakenDaily <- rowsum(activityData$steps, format(activityData$date, '%Y-%m-%d'))
numberOfStepsTakenDaily <- data.frame(numberOfStepsTakenDaily)
names(numberOfStepsTakenDaily) <- ("steps")
```

2.If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(stepsPerDayNoNAs$steps, 
     main = "Histogram - Total Number of Steps Taken Daily (NA omitted)", 
     xlab = "Steps", 
     col = "purple", 
     breaks = 8)
```


3. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(stepsPerDayNoNAs$steps)
median(stepsPerDayNoNAs$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e.  type = "l" ) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(plyr)
avgNumberOfStepsInterval <- ddply(activityData, ~ interval, summarise, mean=mean(steps))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x=interval, y=mean, data = avgNumberOfStepsInterval,  geom = "line", xlab="5-Minute Interval", ylab="Count of Steps",
      main="Average Number of Steps Taken Daily", col = "purple")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
avgNumberOfStepsInterval[which.max(avgNumberOfStepsInterval$mean),]
```

## Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA ). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with  NA s)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
incompleteData <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header=T, quote="\"", sep=",")
names(incompleteData) <- ("steps")
nrow(incompleteData[is.na(incompleteData$steps),])
```

2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(sqldf)
dataset <- sqldf('SELECT d.* FROM "avgNumberOfStepsInterval" as i
JOIN "activityData" as d ON d.interval = i.interval
ORDER BY d.date, d.interval')
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load the data
activityData <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header=T, quote="\"", sep=",")
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# convert date to date data type
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date)
activityDataWithoutNAs <- activityData
activityDataWithoutNAs[is.na(activityDataWithoutNAs$steps), "steps"] <- 0
stepsPerDayNoNAs <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityDataWithoutNAs, sum)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(stepsPerDayNoNAs$steps)
median(stepsPerDayNoNAs$steps)
```

3.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
numberOfSteps <- as.integer(sqldf('SELECT sum(steps) FROM dataset'))

numberOfstepsByDate <- sqldf('SELECT date, sum(steps) as "numberOfStepsByDate" 
    FROM dataset GROUP BY date 
    ORDER BY date')

dailySteps <- sqldf('SELECT date, numberOfstepsByDate as "steps"
    FROM "numberOfstepsByDate"
    ORDER BY date') 
```

4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(numberOfStepsTakenDaily$steps, 
     main="Histogram - Total Number of Steps Taken Daily (NA omitted)", 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
     xlab = "Total Number Of Steps Taken Daily", 
     col = "purple")
```

And Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(numberOfStepsTaken$steps)
median(numberOfStepsTaken$steps)
```

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Yes, these values differ immensely from the first part of the assignment. The introduction of NA values leads to a large mean, and median values.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
For this part the  weekdays()  function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
weekdays <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")

activityData$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(activityData$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))

steps_by_interval_i <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, activityData, mean)

# View the factor
head(steps_by_interval_i)
```
2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e.  type = "l" ) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was created using simulated data:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load the lattice graphical library
library(lattice)

# Draw the Time Series Plot
xyplot(steps_by_interval_i$steps ~ steps_by_interval_i$interval|steps_by_interval_i$dow, 
       main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",
       xlab="Interval", 
       ylab="Steps",
       layout=c(1,2), 
       type="l", 
       col = "purple")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
